# n8n webhook contract

> **Optional.** Since the firmware can fetch Yahoo Finance and cash.ch directly
> (see [Data sources](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/reference/data-sources/)), you only need this if you
> want to own the data source: another provider, caching, auth, custom symbols,
> etc. Set a ticker's source to *Webhook* in the **Ticker** tab to use it.

The SmallTV **pulls** data: it periodically calls your webhook once per ticker.
Any backend that speaks the small JSON contract below works (n8n, Node-RED, a
Flask app, a static file…). Two ready-to-import n8n workflows are included:

- [`smalltv-stock-webhook.json`](smalltv-stock-webhook.json) sources everything
  from Yahoo Finance, the same endpoint the firmware calls on its own.
- [`smalltv-stock-webhook-cash.json`](smalltv-stock-webhook-cash.json) routes
  cash.ch listing keys (symbols like `123456789-246-333`) to cash.ch's public
  GraphQL API and everything else to Yahoo. Since firmware 2.4.0 each ticker
  picks its own source directly on the device, so this workflow is only needed
  if you want webhook tickers to cover both, e.g. to add caching or massage
  the data (see [Data sources](https://giovi321.github.io/smalltv-mod/reference/data-sources/)).

Import one or the other: both use the webhook path `stock`, so n8n will refuse
to activate them side by side.

## Request (device → your webhook)

```
GET  <webhookUrl>?symbol=<SYMBOL>&range=<RANGE>&points=<N>
```

| query    | meaning                                            | example   |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `symbol` | the ticker, exactly as you typed it in the web UI  | `AAPL`, `BTC-USD`, `EURUSD=X` |
| `range`  | the chart timeframe from **Ticker → Chart timeframe** | `1d`, `5d`, `1mo`, `1y` |
| `points` | max sparkline points the device wants              | `48`      |

`<webhookUrl>` is whatever you set in the web UI (e.g.
`http://n8n.local:5678/webhook/stock`). The device appends the query string,
choosing `?` or `&` automatically.

> The device handles **one symbol per request** and rotates through your list.
> This keeps the firmware simple and your workflow trivial (one symbol in → one
> object out).

## Response (your webhook → device)

`Content-Type: application/json`, a **single JSON object**:

```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "name": "Apple Inc.",
  "price": 234.56,
  "currency": "$",
  "change": 2.34,
  "changePct": 1.01,
  "spark": [230.1, 231.0, 229.8, 233.2, 234.56],
  "range": "1D",
  "ok": true
}
```

| field       | type    | required | notes |
|-------------|---------|----------|-------|
| `price`     | number  | **yes**  | current value. If missing/`null`, the device shows an error for this ticker. |
| `name`      | string  | no       | shown instead of the symbol. Defaults to the symbol. Keep it short (≤ ~12 chars look best). |
| `currency`  | string  | no       | prefix shown before the price, e.g. `"$"`, `"€"`, `""`. |
| `change`    | number  | no       | absolute change in price units. |
| `changePct` | number  | no       | percentage change. |
| `spark`     | array   | no       | close prices, **oldest → newest**, max 60 points. Drives the chart. |
| `range`     | string  | no       | label shown bottom-right, e.g. `"1D"`. Defaults to the requested range. |
| `ok`        | boolean | no       | set `false` to explicitly signal "no data" for this symbol. |

Notes:
- You may send **only one** of `change` / `changePct`; the device derives the
  other from `price`.
- `change`/`changePct` colour everything: ≥ 0 → up colour, < 0 → down colour
  (green/red, swappable in the UI).
- Extra fields are ignored, so you can add your own without breaking anything.

## Import the example workflow

1. n8n → **Workflows → Import from File** → pick `smalltv-stock-webhook.json`.
2. Open the **Webhook** node, copy its **Production URL**
   (looks like `https://<your-n8n>/webhook/stock`).
3. **Activate** the workflow.
4. Put that URL in the SmallTV web UI under **Ticker → Webhook URL**, and add
   your tickers in the same tab with their source set to *Webhook*.

The example maps the timeframe to a candle interval like this:

| `range` | Yahoo interval |
|---------|----------------|
| `1d`    | 5m  |
| `5d`    | 30m |
| `1mo` / `3mo` / `6mo` / `ytd` | 1d |
| `1y` / `2y` | 1wk |
| `5y` / `max` | 1mo |

### HTTPS note for the ESP8266

The ESP8266 can do HTTPS, but TLS is RAM-hungry. If you hit instability, expose
the webhook over plain **HTTP on your LAN** (the device is LAN-only anyway) and
set the webhook URL to `http://…`. The firmware auto-detects `http`/`https` from the
URL scheme; HTTPS is validated *insecurely* (no certificate check), which is fine
for a self-hosted endpoint on your own network.
