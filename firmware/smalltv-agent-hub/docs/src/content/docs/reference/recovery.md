## Going back to stock

Keep a `stock-backup.bin` from before your first flash and you can always return the device to factory.

- **Re-flash anything** (your stock backup or this firmware) with the method for your board, described in [Flashing](/smalltv-mod/getting-started/flashing/).
- **Factory reset** in the System tab wipes saved settings and restarts in SETUP MODE. It does not change the firmware.
- On the ESP32 boards, a bad flash never bricks the device: it still enters download mode, so esptool can rewrite it — over USB on the C2 and the NM-TV-154, or over the internal UART header on the SmallTV Pro (no USB-serial chip; see [Flashing](/smalltv-mod/getting-started/flashing/#smalltv-pro-classic-esp32-8-mb)).

## Notes and limitations

- 2.4 GHz WiFi only. WPA2. For an AP password use at least 8 characters, or leave it blank for an open hotspot.
- The web server is single-threaded, so the UI may pause briefly during a data poll.
- HTTPS works on the ESP8266 but is RAM-tight. Prefer plain HTTP on your LAN for a webhook if you see instability. The ESP32 boards have more headroom.
- The GitHub self-update works on every board from 2.7.0. The ESP32 boards download in place; the ESP8266 updates at boot (two reboots — see [Flashing](/smalltv-mod/getting-started/flashing/#after-the-first-flash)). ESP8266 devices still on 2.6.1 or older have a broken updater and need one manual upload in the System tab to get current.
- Fonts are the built-in bitmap font, scaled, chosen for reliability and the retro look. No external font files are needed.

- The plane radar's look reimplements [MatixYo/ESP32-Plane-Radar](https://github.com/MatixYo/ESP32-Plane-Radar), a sonar-style ADS-B radar for a 1.28" round display: heading triangles, speed vectors, callsign and altitude tags, and rim dots for out-of-range traffic all come from that design.
- Claude usage mode reimplements [clawdmeter](https://github.com/HermannBjorgvin/Clawdmeter) for this hardware, over HTTP and WiFi instead of serial. The mascot frames come from [claudepix](https://claudepix.vercel.app).
