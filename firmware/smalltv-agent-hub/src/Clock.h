// Clock.h — SNTP wall-clock + scheduled night-mode window with an NTP-trust gate.
//
// Owns the device's only notion of real time: arms SNTP with the configured
// POSIX TZ rule (DST handled by the rule), and runs the night-mode state machine.
// Night mode only switches ON when the clock was confirmed by a recent NTP sync
// (clockTrusted): if NTP can't be reached the screen stays on and SNTP is re-armed
// until a fresh sync lands or the window ends. Once on, it stays on until the
// window ends (morning). clockService() drives this; clockNightActive() reads it.
