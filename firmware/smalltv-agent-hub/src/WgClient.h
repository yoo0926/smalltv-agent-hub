// WgClient.h — optional WireGuard tunnel, so the device can be reached from
// outside the LAN without forwarding its plain-HTTP port to the internet.
//
// Compiled only where the chip has the flash and the RAM for it: the ESP32
// targets define SMALLTV_WIREGUARD in platformio.ini. On the ESP8266 (and any
// build without the flag) every function below is a no-op stub and the status
// reports compiledIn=false, so call sites need no #ifdef.
//
// The tunnel is driven from loop() as a small state machine (idle -> init ->
// connect -> allowed -> monitor) rather than its own task, and every call into
// the component is marshalled onto the lwIP thread, because esp_wireguard
// drives raw lwIP and Arduino's prebuilt IDF has core locking off.
