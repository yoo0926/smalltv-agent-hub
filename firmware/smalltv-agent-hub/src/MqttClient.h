// MqttClient.h — MQTT connection for the Home Assistant screens feature.
//
// PubSubClient over a plain WiFiClient (non-TLS, LAN broker). Everything is
// driven from mqttLoop() off the main loop: connect only while WiFi STA is up,
// reconnect with a millis()-based backoff, never block waiting. The wire
// contract (docs: features/ha):
//   LWT  smalltv/<hostname>/availability = "offline", retained
//   on connect: publish "online" retained to the same topic, then subscribe
//   smalltv/<hostname>/screen/+ — one retained JSON screen per slot.
// Incoming screen messages go straight to the HaScreens store.
//
// Brightness over MQTT (kept in sync with the web UI):
//   command  smalltv/<hostname>/brightness/set  — plain integer 0..100;
//            applied through appApplyBrightness() like the web UI and persisted
//            debounced (~5 s) so a flapping slider doesn't wear the flash.
//   state    smalltv/<hostname>/brightness      — plain integer, retained;
//            published on every connect and whenever settings.brightness
//            changes from any source (poll-and-compare in mqttLoop).
//   discovery: a retained Home Assistant `number` config under
//            homeassistant/number/smalltv_<hostname>_brightness/config, plus a
//            homeassistant/status subscription so an HA restart ("online")
//            re-sends the config and the current state. Harmless on brokers
//            that aren't HA's.
//
// Broker settings changes (web UI save) are picked up live: the loop compares
// a snapshot of what it connected with against the current settings and
// reconnects when they differ.
